<p>Ray: Doc I don’t know. I used to be a really radiant energetic guy. People were in awe of my brilliance; drawn to my warmth. I had a shining personality.  I’d just walk into a room and it would light up. I was cheerful, lighthearted and always saw the bright side of things. I never had a shadow in my life.</p>

<p>Doc: So what changed?</p>

<p>Ray: I don’t know... my life’s just gone dark. I’m just so heavy now. My friends tell me, Ray lighten up. But I can’t. I just want to burst out and shine but feel so disconnected. Is there any hope for a new dawn in my life?

<p>Doc: Ray, do you believe in the sun?</p>

<p>Ray: Oh no, Please, Doc, don't start up with ray-ligion. I gave up believing in the sun long time ago. For years, as a kid, I went to Sunday school and hated it. My parents forced me to go to sunagogue. And not a few times, Doc, I was beat up by Anti-Sunites.</p>

<p>Doc: I understand</p>

<p>Ray: My parents told me that we’re all children of the sun- that we’re the light of His life. And that the secret to happiness was to serve Him. Well no thank you. I’m no slave.</p>

<p>Doc: Ray, the Sun is not a tyrant imposing his will on us. He’s the Source of our lives, the Soul of our souls; He’s our shared Greater Self. We cannot but want to serve the Sun because we are rays of His light; through us He becomes present on earth.</p>

<p>Ray: Doc, You're freaking me out.</p> 

<p>Doc: Ray, the Sun loves us with the very love he loves himself because we are a part of Him.</p>

<p>Ray: Doc, I'm not the ray-ligious kind of guy. Not the holy type.</p>

<p>Doc: I'm talking about you, Ray, not religion. To be holy means to be completely and Wholly     w- h-o-l--l-y you.</p>

<p>Ray: Doc, I don't feel it. Maybe I'm just not connected to the sun. Maybe I'm a sinner.</p> 

<p>Doc: Ray you’re always connected. No act can change that fact. You're forever a part of the Sun. It’s only your beliefs and lifestyle that set you a part from Him in your mind.</p>

<p>Ray: So what do I have to do?</p>

<p>Doc: Ray act in ways that portray and not betray you.</p>

<p>Ray: So it’s fake it till you make it. Doc, I can't pretend to be someone I'm not.</p>

<p>Doc: No, Ray. It’s fake it till you awake it. Deep within we know the truth. The path to wellness is to make the unconscious conscious.</p>

<p>Ray: Huh? You lost me Doc.</p>

<p>Doc: Ray the feeling of disconnect depresses you because deep inside, you know it’s not true. Ray we’re rays of the sun. We’re connected this very moment.</p>

<p>Ray: So then why do I feel so bad if the connection can never be broken?</p>

<p>Doc: Your connection can never be broken but it can be denied. The conflict between who you are and what you believe about yourself is causing you all this stress and sadness.</p>

<p>Ray: So what do I have to do to my let light shine again?</p>

<p>Doc: Ray, That's precisely your problem. Listen to what you’re saying. You think it's your light. It's not your light it’s His. All the powers within us are not from us. And they're not just His gifts to us they're His presence within us.</p>

<p>Ray: You mean, feeling great starts with feeling grateful.</p>

<p>Doc: Right on.</p>

<p>Ray: Doc, you're brilliant.</p>  

<p>Doc: No Ray, He's brilliant. [Doc points to the sun]</p>

<p>Ray: Oh ya. Well thanks for being wholly you. I’m already starting to feel sun-sational.</p>

##Secret Life Of God by Rabbi David Aaron 
###Chapter 1
<div toggly> 

<!DOCTYPE html>

<body>

<p><b>Living God’s
Secret Life</b></p>

<p>Grasping the truth about life is like watching a photograph in the midst of the developing process—first there is a little gray emerging in the corner; then something a little darker appears in the middle; little by little the shadows fill in, definitions appear, and eventually the actual images are visible. But it is only when the whole picture emerges can you really understand what you are seeing.</p>
	<p>Photographs never develop in a linear or a horizontal way—it is always a little here and a little there. Truth is very much like that—if you want to grasp it, you must wait until you see the whole picture. So please be patient as you read this book. The beginning will make even more sense as you progress toward the end. However, even after you get the whole picture, you have to remember it is just a “picture” of the truth. It is not the truth itself. The picture is no more the truth than a menu is the meal. No matter how delicious the descriptions on the menu sound, you have to taste the food to know what it is.</p>
<p>I once saw a frustrated cat attacking a picture of a hamburger hanging in the bottom corner of the window of a restaurant. In his hunger, he had confused the picture with the food. It is important that you don't make the same mistake and confuse the picture with the truth.</p>
	<p>The picture is only an approximation of the truth in words and concepts. To know the truth, you have to experience it. This is especially true when it comes to Kabbalah. The writings of Kabbalah are like sheet music. A person who can’t read sheet music would never believe that these lines, dots, squiggles, and numbers actually express passion, harmony, and movement. Sheet music looks very technical, rigid, and mathematical. But, even though at first glance it doesn't seem to be music, it is, and only a musician knows how to translate the sheet music into song. To appreciate Kabbalah, you need to learn how to translate its sheet music into song.</p>
<p>There are lots of books for sale on Kabbalah and Jewish mysticism, and when you finish reading some of them (particularly the more sophisticated ones), you are indeed mystified, unable to figure out what on earth the author's talking about. But that's a false impression. Kabbalah really does make sense. It can be understood, if you remember to distinguish between the sheet music and the song, the menu and the meal, the picture of truth and the truth.</p>
<p>Kabbalah makes sense, but it does not always make logical sense to our minds, like the equation 1 + 1 = 2. Kabbalah makes spiritual sense to our souls, like the equation 1 + 1 = 1, which is the equation of love. Love makes sense, but to understand it you can’t just think about it; you have to experience it.</p>
<p>So first we will take a look at the sheet music of Kabbalah. However, keep in mind that even the sheet music that I'm presenting is not the complete work—I cannot possibly discuss in one book all the divine melodies written for the symphony of life. So this is an abridged version—a “sketchy” picture of the truth, if you will. But even so, it will be suffice in answering the deep questions that will be asked.</p>
In this first chapter, you will discover answers to some of the most serious and challenging questions ever asked about God. But to fully understand these answers you will have to experience them in your own life.</p> 

<p><b>The Questions</b></p>

<p>•	Is God perfect?</p>
<p>•	If God is perfect, why did He create such an imperfect world and such an imperfect me?</p>
<p>•	Can God fail, struggle with failure, and experience the ecstasy of triumph?</p>
<p>•	Does God suffer? Can He rise to the challenge of suffering, transcend suffering, and feel pleasure?</p>
<p>•	Does God feel sadness? Can He struggle with sadness, overcome sadness, and achieve joy?</p>
<p>•	Can God make mistakes, regret, repent, and grow from mistakes?</p>
<p>•	Is God absolutely good?</p>
<p>•	If God is absolutely good, can He struggle with evil and triumphantly choose the good? </p>
<p>•	Why did God create a world that has so much potential for evil?</p>
<p>•	Why does God allow evil people to exist?</p>

<p>In answering these questions, we are going to explore some incredibly powerful images ideas that reveal who is God, who are we, why we exist, and who we may become.</p>


<p><b>A New Picture</b></p>

<p>One day, as I was taking a walk in Manhattan, I suddenly became very aware of the tall skyscrapers and the hustle bustle of the thousands of people around me. It was an intimidating feeling. When I got to the street corner, the light turned red, and, as I waited, a crowd started to close in around me, making me feel squeezed and overwhelmed. All of a sudden it hit me: “I am nothing more than a fiber in this huge blob of meat, in this New York melting pot of flesh.” When the light turned green, I was carried off by the massive crowds of Manhattan, feeling myself drowning in the stream of melting humanity. Just as I got to the other side of the street, I saw a flyer taped on a telephone post. In an almost unreadable scrawl, it announced:</p>

<p>Come to the Cocoa Café
and hear the GREATEST guitar player in the WORLD.
BE THERE OR BE SQUARE.  </p>

<p>Now, that was a bit too much for me. It was hard enough to be a nothing, but to be a “square nothing” was beyond what I could handle. But more than that, I was really shocked that in the midst of this enormous world where everyone is nothing, there was someone who had the chutzpah, the gall, to think he is not only something, but the greatest something in the world. 
And I suddenly felt that, somehow, he could be right.</p>
<p>Sir Arthur Eddington, the famous astrophysicist, explains that if we were to make a parallel between the universe and Grand Central Station filled to the rafters with dust, then one speck of dust would be proportionately equal to the size of planet Earth. Now, consider: if approximately six billion people live on our planetary speck of dust, then that would mean that you and I are at most one-sixth of a billionth of a speck of dust, and we are not even taking into consideration all the animals and all the trees and the minuscule creatures that inhabit our planet.</p>
<p>The song “Dust in the Wind” is actually very optimistic, because we are much less than dust in the wind. And yet, although scientifically I am “nothing”—how else can I put it?—deep inside I know that I am something. Somehow inside I feel that I am significant. I dare to believe that I really make a difference in this world.</p>
<p>So who are we? Why are we? Why did God create us? And does our existence really matter?</p>
<p>In answer, let me share with you a story from Kabbalah. In reading this story, keep in mind that Kabbalah does not call God “God.” When Kabbalah describes the Creator of the universe, it calls Him the Ein Sof, “the Endless One.” Furthermore, Kabbalah, and all other sources of Jewish wisdom, assume that God is unknowable, that we can only know those aspects of God that are revealed to us. Therefore, the sages speak about the light of God—the “Endless Light”—which is a metaphor for revelation. What we can know about God is only that which is revealed to us.</p>
<p>So now for our story:
	When the Endless One wanted to create the world, He withdrew His Endless Light from the center, creating a spherical vacuum. In this vacuum, the Endless One created vessels and then projected a thin ray of Endless Light into the vessels. But because the vessels were unable to contain the light, they broke, and the cosmos went into a state of chaos. Kabbalah goes on to explain that life is meant to be a process of tikkun, meaning “repair,” “fix” or “reconstruct.” The vessels must be reconstructed so that they will one day succeed in holding the light. Life is all about fixing the broken vessels so that they will be able to receive the light.</p> 
<p>Kabbalah ends this story with a paradox. It states that although the light surrounds the spherical vacuum, it still fills the vacuum. This means that the light was withdrawn and yet mysteriously continues to remain in place.</p>
<p>Paradox is not a problem for Kabbalah, because life does not have to fit into the neat prerequisites of logic as formulated by the Greeks. Jewish tradition does not believe that God thinks as we do nor that He created the world according to our way of thinking. Indeed, God said: “My thoughts are not like your thoughts” (Isaiah 55:8). The universe functions according to a divine supernal logic.</p>
<p>One of the greatest challenges to modern science has been posed by the paradoxes of the world. For instance, when it was discovered that light was both a wave and a particle, science had no choice but to question the logic of logic. For light to be both a wave and a particle was a contradiction; thus science needed to accept that reality does not always function according to our preconceived “either/or” structure. Perhaps there is another kind of logic beyond the limitations of either/or.</p>
	<p>Indeed, science developed a new kind of logic, called quantum logic. But the Kabbalists knew quantum logic long before the scientists; they knew the theory of relativity long before Einstein. This is why the Kabbalists would never think of describing the world from God’s perspective. We could not have God’s perspective unless we were God. As noted above, what we can know about God is only that which is revealed to us, in relation to our own perception.</p>
<p>Incidentally, scientists make the same disclaimer. They say, “We are not describing the particle as it is, but only the way it looks to us. Therefore, light can be both a wave and a particle. Light looks different depending on the experiment we set up. Everything is relative to our human perspective.”</p>
<p>With that Kabbalah agrees one hundred percent, adding: And that includes our view of God. </p>    
<p>When we try to articulate the truth about God with our logical minds, we end up with paradoxical statements. Please remember not to confuse the menu with the meal. Although the menu is a paradox, the meal is paradise.</p> 


<p><b>Is God Perfect?</b></p>

<p>In order to understand this kabbalistic story and its underlying paradoxical reasoning, we have to ask a question that will initially sound ridiculous: Is God perfect, and if so, can a perfect God become perfect? 
Now, most of us would immediately answer, “If God could become perfect, that would mean that initially God was not perfect. Therefore, if He is perfect, He cannot become perfect.”</p>
<p>But when we think about it a little more, we might ask, “If the ‘Perfect One’ could not become perfect, would that not be an imperfection? Would that not be a limitation? Would that mean that the perfect God could not participate in a dynamic process of growth and change from imperfect to more and more perfection? Would that mean that God lives a static, boring, unadventurous life? Is God lacking the joy in life that we have—the joy in challenge and accomplishment “accomplishing” was intentional because it is about the process but if it is confusing then do what you think?”</p>
           <p>“Can the perfect God become perfect?” is similar to the question people sometimes ask to drive theologians crazy: Can God create a rock that He Himself cannot pick up?</p>
<p>Of course, if you say no, then they'll say that God is not All-Powerful. “What, He can't create a rock that He cannot pick up?”</p>
<p>So you say, “Oh, O.K., so then, yes, God can create such rock.” But then they scoff, “You mean, He is not Almighty? He can't pick it up?”</p>
	<p>That question pushes you into a logical corner. But Kabbalah has an answer. The answer is yes and no.</p>
<p>You might say, “It must be either yes or no.” However, that would be demanding of God (who is the Ultimate Reality and the Source of all logic) to fit into the rigid confines of human logic. Who says the Ultimate Reality functions according to human logic? Who says that the logical human mind is constructed in a way that it can completely describe the Ultimate Reality?</p>
<p>Kabbalah says the answer is yes and no, because God is beyond the either/or. And therefore when we pose the question “Can the perfect become perfect?” the answer is yes and no.</p>
	<p>In other words, when we describe the absolute perfection of God, we must describe it in a paradoxical way. Absolute perfection has the possibility for two types of perfection, which can exist simultaneously—being perfect and becoming perfect. In other words, absolute perfection includes a possibility for both a static perfection that never changes and a dynamic perfection, which is ever changing, evolving, and growing from “imperfection” to “more perfection.” </p>

                   <p><i>ABSOLUTE PERFECTION</i></p>

    <p><i>being perfect-------becoming perfect</i></p>
   <p><i>static perfection-------dynamic perfection</i></p>
      <p><i>never-changing-------ever-changing</i></p>

<p>However, remember that this is a description relative to our limited viewpoint; from God’s perspective, there is simply oneness. It is only because of the limitation of our logical minds that we describe the one God as having two types of perfection—a static perfection and a dynamic perfection; being perfect and becoming perfect.</p>
<p>Therefore, when we describe God, the Ultimate Reality, the Absolutely Perfect One, we would have to say that included within the full definition of God’s absolute perfection is the possibility of becoming perfect (from imperfection toward greater and greater perfection) while being perfect.
Please notice, I am very careful with my words: I speak of a possibility. I do not say that God necessarily must become perfect, because that would be a limitation. God doesn’t have to do anything. God acts freely. However, becoming perfect calls for something to perfect, an imperfection.</p> <p>Therefore, included within absolute perfection is the possibility for imperfection as the foundation of a process of becoming perfect.
Here is how it would be expressed in the language of the Kabbalah. In the beginning there was Endless Light—Absolute Perfection. When God, the Endless One, wanted to create the possibility for a process of becoming perfect, He removed His Absolute Perfection and created a vacuum, a lack, an emptiness. Within that vacuum God created limited vessels and gave them Endless Light, even though He knew that they couldn’t handle it and would break. In other words, God intentionally caused a breakdown, chaos, and imperfection. God wanted the vessels to get a taste of the perfect light even though they would break down, so that they would yearn, work, and grow toward perfection. In this way God created imperfection and set in motion a dynamic process of growth and becoming toward perfection. However, although the Endless Light surrounds this vacuum, it still fills it—and there continues to be static perfection. Therefore, mysteriously there exists simultaneously both being perfect and becoming perfect.</p>
<p>In summary, included within the Divine is a dynamic process at work. Within the Divine is the possibility for imperfection that grows toward perfection.</p> 
<p>Now we can understand why you and I exist. We are the imperfect vessels. God created imperfect human beings who struggle to become better and gradually work their way toward becoming more and more perfect. We are the broken vessels, and it is through us that God fulfills His desire to express and participate in a process of becoming perfect. </p>
<p>You and I, who are imperfect, struggling in an imperfect world, working toward achieving more perfection, are actually necessary vehicles for the expression of the dynamic aspect of divine perfection. We are those broken vessels living in a world of chaos, but we have a memory of a perfect light, which we yearn for and strive toward. We are born in this world restless to get somewhere. We are born with a thirst for achieving the unlimited power of perfection because we have, although just for a moment, tasted it. </p>
<p>Absolute perfection includes the possibility for a dynamic perfection. When God chose to actualize this possibility, then you and I were created as the vehicles for the expression of this type of perfection—this aspect of Divinity. This is what’s divine about our humanness. This is what’s perfect about our imperfection. This is what’s perfect about our constant desire and struggle to build and improve our world and ourselves.</p>


<p><b>Does God Need Us?</b></p>

<p>When I was a kid I thought that God was bored and wanted a pet to play with, since, when I was bored, I amused myself with my pet guinea pig, putting him through all sorts of interesting challenges involving mazes and obstacles that I made out of cardboard. So I thought that God did the same thing, except that I was the guinea pig.</p>
<p>Many adults today have a similar idea of God and creation. They think that God was floating in outer space somewhere and for some whimsical and ludicrous reason decided to create people. They will say that God didn't need to create you or me, and has no vested interest in us, but He just “felt like” creating us.</p>
<p>Such a perspective robs us of any intrinsic divine value. It robs us of any ultimate significance. It communicates that essentially we can do nothing for God, except perhaps amuse Him in moments of boredom; we have nothing ultimate to contribute. Our existence really doesn’t matter or make a difference to God.</p>
<p>But that is not true. And once you understand the depths of what Kabbalah is teaching, you begin to realize how significant you are. God needs us—or, to be more accurate, God chooses to need us. God doesn't need to manifest dynamic perfection, though He is free to do so. However, once God chooses to manifest this possibility, then imperfect you and I—struggling in this imperfect world in a process of becoming, striving to toward perfection—are necessary to God. This is what Jewish tradition means when it teaches that the work of humanity is of lofty necessity to God. 
It’s been said that happiness is the certainty of being needed. If you feel that you are completely disposable and unnecessary, if you think that nobody needs you, then you're not going to be happy. Human beings need to feel needed. And that is because we are.</p>
<p>Kabbalah reveals that God chooses to need us. Our humanness, our imperfection and struggle toward becoming perfect, are necessary and meaningful to God as part of God’s desire to express and participate in this type of “perfection becoming perfect.”</p>


<p><b>Why Did God Create This Imperfect World?</b></p>

<p>If God is perfect, then why did he create such an imperfect world filled with imperfect people? </p>
	<p>The very first verse of the Book of Genesis tells us: “In the beginning God created heaven and earth, and earth was in a state of chaos.” This sounds like God did a pretty crummy job. The minute He creates the world, it's already in a state of chaos.</p></p>
<p>But the truth is that God did a perfect job. What's perfect about this world is the chaos! It's the perfect place for growth. It's the perfect place for challenge. It's the perfect setting for triumph. It is the perfect stage for an exciting drama about becoming perfect.
If you struggle with the chaos within you and around you and turn it into order, then you are doing a great divine service. If you acknowledge your imperfections and the imperfections of this world, work hard, and rise to the challenge to fix them, then you are a vehicle for the expression of God’s dynamic perfection.</p>
<p>This is our human greatness. This is our mission on earth and service to God. We are human characters in a divine drama. </p>
<p>“Nobody’s perfect” is precisely what's so perfect about everybody. However, this is true only when you use your imperfections as starting points for growth. If you don’t, then you are not part of the divine process and God is not part of your life. You have forfeited the very meaning and value of your existence.</p>
<p>This world is meant to be difficult, and your life on earth is meant to be a struggle, filled with adventure, challenge, and victory. This is your divine mission if you are willing to accept it. And if you accept it, you will have the power to succeed.</p>
<p>Why did God create an imperfect world filled with imperfect people? Because God’s absolute perfection includes the possibility for dynamic perfection—becoming perfect. This type of perfection is expressed through imperfect you and me, struggling in this imperfect world to improve ourselves and this world, striving and working hard toward becoming perfect.</p>


<p><b>Can God Fail?</b></p>

<p>If God is perfect, does He lack the ability to fail, struggle, and be triumphant?</p>
<p>Would you want a life without the possibility of failure? Could you really win if you could never fail? Would you want to play a football game against a team of five-year-olds when you know for sure you'd win? What fun is that?</p>
<p>You want to play a game that is more challenging. You want to play a game that you know there is a chance that you will lose, but you want to fight until you win. If there is no possibility of losing, then there is no possibility of winning. Indeed, there would be no adventure and no fun to the game. There really is no game. Players often come back from a hard game, bruised, limping, and yet praising, “What a great game!”
We all love the challenge, the possibility of failure, the opportunity to struggle, and the ecstasy of victory.</p>
<p>Is it possible that God lacks this? No! God participates in all this through you and me. God created the human being and invested in that imperfect being an aspect of the divine self—the soul. The Jewish tradition metaphorically describes the soul, the real you, as a spark of God. 
I often wondered, “What's a spark of the perfect God doing in an imperfect character like me, and in an imperfect world like this?”
The Kabbalah gave me the answer: “That's what’s so great about you—that you're not so great! And that's what's so perfect about you—that you're not so perfect!”</p>
<p>The human enterprise is an essential vehicle for the expression of divine dynamic perfection. God’s absolute perfection includes the possibility for simultaneously being perfect and becoming perfect. The light surrounds the vacuum. There is a vacuum. There is emptiness and there is lack. There is deficiency and breakdown. There are problems and there is a mess. And therefore there's an opportunity for change, struggle, adventure, challenge, creativity, and excitement. This is the exciting game of life. </p>
<p>God does not lack participation in failure, struggle, and triumph, because He invested a spark of His Divinity in the human being—an imperfect character living in this difficult and challenging world. God lives in this world and partakes in the challenge and adventure of becoming perfect through you and me. This does not mean that we are God. But it does mean that we are an aspect of God—you and I are sparks of God. And this we must always remember, that although God is manifest within us, He continues to be beyond us.</p>


<p><b>Does God Suffer?</b></p> 

<p>What would life be like if there was no suffering? Would there be pleasure? Imagine if you were rich, your friends were rich, and you lived in an entirely rich neighborhood. And let’s say you lived a very sheltered life and never saw one magazine, newspaper, or movie that dealt with the topic of poverty. Would you be rich if you'd never experienced or heard of poverty? </p>
<p>Kirk Douglas, the legendary actor, once told me, “I gave my children everything but one gift I couldn't give them, the gift of poverty.” Kirk grew up in a poverty-stricken home. There were nine members in his family, and sometimes all they had was only one egg.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago a woman registered for one of my seminars at Isralight, the spiritual retreat center that I founded. She was one of the most amazing people I had ever met. She was radiant with the joy of life.
I said to her, “You are a remarkable person; you're really beaming with light.” Missing quotation</p>
<p>She responded, “Oh, Rabbi, I can tell you why.” She pulled up her sleeve and showed me scars running down her arm. Then she showed me her other arm, also filled with scars.</p>
<p>She said, “Rabbi, I have scars all over my body. About five years ago I was in a car accident. My friend was at the wheel and lost control of the car, and it went over a cliff. The car rolled over a number of times and finally came to a halt. In that moment, I realized that I was still conscious, I was still alive. I pulled myself out of the car, but then I saw that my friend was wedged into the wreck. So I ran back to pull her out. At that point the car exploded. And I exploded with the car. The ambulance came and took me to the hospital. I was put into rehabilitation for about a year and a half, to relearn the basic motor skills of life. Rabbi, I have to tell you, that it was the greatest gift of my life. My radiance and happiness did not come without much pain and work.”</p>
<p>Many of the great leaders who have impacted upon civilization had very difficult lives. Their strength of character, drive, and determination rarely came without a high price of challenge, pain, and struggle. Their lives were a roller-coaster, not a merry-go-round. Most of them would admit that their zeal for life, intellectual depth, idealistic vision, and commitment came from much anguish and conflict.</p>
<p>I once addressed a group of people in Miami who had suffered much damage from Hurricane Andrew. The class was titled “Serenity and Suffering,” and it was held in a home that was hit badly by the 1992 hurricane. You could see that the attendees were still devastated by the horrifying experience they had gone through. I asked them how they were feeling, and I was shocked by their response:</p>
<p>“It was so amazing! We felt so much love for each other—like we never felt before. We will forever cherish the awesome feelings of unity, compassion, and sensitivity that emerged during those frightening times. Although we experienced very painful moments, there were so many precious feelings and realizations that we achieved precisely because of those painful moments.”</p>
<p>Does God experience these great pleasures of life that come only through the challenges and difficulties of life on earth? Does God suffer, struggle with suffering, transcend suffering, and experience the pleasure of triumph? </p>
<p>Yes, through you and me! </p>
	<p>If you read the personal accounts of Holocaust survivors, you will find that each and every one of them is a masterpiece. I fully understand why Steven Spielberg invested millions of dollars toward the creation of a Holocaust archive collecting every testimony possible. As a producer and a director, he understands that every single one of those stories is Oscar-winning (though I'm sure he's not doing it to win any Oscars). These reports are the epic dramas of hearts and souls, of people who in their struggles achieved beautiful qualities of love, care, integrity, trust, hope, courage—the list is endless.</p>
<p>Yes, there were failures. Not always did these horrifying scenes bring out the best in everyone. Yes, there were many tragic endings. But that's the price. The price for good is the possibility for evil, the price for love is the possibility for hatred, the price for happiness is the possibility for sadness, and the price for victory is the possibility for failure.</p>
<p>Can God pay the price, rise to these challenges that only life on earth provides, and achieve goodness, love, happiness, and victory?</p>
<p>Yes, through you and me. </p>
<p>And we can experience that ecstatic truth when we invite God into our daily struggles by praying and by rising to the challenges and improving this world and ourselves for God’s sake. This is the true meaning of serving God. This is what we can do for God.</p>
<p>Life is a divine drama. The theme of the drama of life is all about challenge, choices, growth, and love. It’s all about the journey. We—with all our problems and complexities—are the stars of the show. The ideal setting is this messed-up world. Our true inner self, however, is none other than the soul—a spark of God. </p>
<p>Our mission is to accept the challenge and turn it into a service to God. Our deepest fulfillment and ultimate meaning comes from the knowledge that God needs us and joins us in order to participate in a dynamic and challenging process of becoming perfect. </p>
<p>God lives His secret life through you and me, if we let Him in.</p>


<p><b>Does God Feel Sadness?</b></p>
	
<p>Many years ago, when I returned from a trip to Israel, my parents picked me up at the airport and sadly told me that we were going to the funeral of my cousin, who had been killed in a car accident. At the funeral, the rabbi said something that angered me very much and challenged my faith in God. In his eulogy, the rabbi quoted a Yiddish saying: “What do we know? People try to figure it out, and God is laughing.”</p>
<p>The rabbi seemed to be saying that it's only from our perspective that terrible accidents look terrible. We see the back of the tapestry of life, and it looks to us like random strands of knotted wool. God, however, sees the whole beautiful picture on the right side of the tapestry, and He's laughing because everything is in order, everything makes sense.
But the rabbi's words really upset me. Bully for God that He knows it all. But what about us? I felt like we were stupid little mice scurrying around in pain and fear, trying to find our way through a maze, while God was laughing. I didn't like that image of God at all. It only confirmed my childhood ideas, which I had been working so hard to get rid of.</p>
<p>But I completely misunderstood. It seemed to me as if the rabbi was saying that God is transcendent and completely removed from our pain and sadness in this world. But that's not true. Yes, the Torah and Kabbalah teach that God is transcendent, “outside” the world, a perfect being. But the Torah and Kabbalah also teach that God is imminent, “inside” this world, and manifest as a perfect becoming—the very soul of humanity, completely immersed in our ups and downs, our happy times and our sad times.
A story is told about a businessman whose company purchased a coal mine. However, shortly after the sale, the price of coal began to drop in response to the fluctuation in fossil fuels. Distressed by the financial loss, the man went to get advice from a Kabbalist. The sage told him, “The Talmud says that when a person is in distress this causes the Shekhinah, God's Presence in the world, also to feel anguish. If you are in pain over your financial loss, this causes God to suffer along with you. So what do you think? Is it worthwhile causing God to be saddened over a few pieces of coal?”</p>
<p>Life is difficult. But then again, it depends on how you look at it. I once watched my kids take hundreds of pieces of a puzzle and spend long, hard hours putting it together. I had planned to frame it once it was finished, but they had a different idea. They celebrated its completion by destroying it. Why? Because they were not interested in the puzzle’s being completed! They were interested in the excitement of doing the puzzle, the challenge and adventure of making it. That's what they enjoyed about it. 
They understood what we should all understand. There's so much life and value in the process, so much growth and awareness in the journey, as difficult as it may sometimes be. </p>
<p>Kabbalah teaches us that God takes the journey with us. God is intimately involved in our daily challenges and struggles, in our ups and downs. God shares our pains and troubles as well as our pleasures and successes. Knowing this makes difficult experiences more manageable and more meaningful. Knowing this also makes the good times even better. I have heard it said that when you share your sadness with another person it is halved, and when you share your joy it is doubled. This all the more so when you realize that God shares in your sadness and joys.</p> 
 <p>We are all here for the journey. However, we get the most out of our journey when we turn it into a holy journey by acknowledging that God is with us. </p>


<p><b>Can God Make Mistakes?</b></p>	

<p>Can God make mistakes, regret, repent, and experience the joy in growing from mistakes?</p>
<p>Yes, through you and me.</p>
<p>It's important to understand that the theme of life is teshuvah. Most commonly translated as “repentance,” teshuvah has nothing to do with the beating one’s breast and undergoing penance (as in sackcloth and ashes); it means literally “to return” and describes specifically the intricate process of returning to God, returning to a life of growth and dynamic perfection, accepting anew the opportunity for serving God.
This intricate process begins with fixing one’s mistakes and resolving not to repeat them, but it’s more than that.</p>
<p>Kabbalah teaches that teshuvah is the theme of the cosmos. God intentionally set in motion the breaking of the vessels. He intentionally created a world full of chaos so that there would be an opportunity for challenge, which would create the possibility of error. Having made mistakes, we can then experience remorse and struggle to find the courage to change for the better. We can then humble ourselves to ask forgiveness and commit ourselves to continued growth.</p>
<p>Therefore, teshuvah isn't relevant exclusively to individuals and their mistakes. Whatever one does affects the entire cosmos, because everything that happens works toward the making of order out of the chaos and contributes to the process of becoming perfect.</p>
<p>Teshuvah is actually the theme of life. We are always in the midst of teshuvah. Life is an endless journey—an adventure in becoming. It's all about improving, building, and accomplishing—that’s what we love doing.
It doesn’t always seem so wonderful. But if it did, there would be no growth. We would miss the opportunity to make mistakes, grow from them, celebrate the triumph, and experience the sweetness of forgiveness.
God put you in this world (which is one great obstacle course) but also joins you in the challenge.</p>
    	<p>God is like a great coach who’s training you for the Olympics. He sets up a training ground filled with obstacles. That is His gift to you. He is really creating opportunities for you to jump higher. He also knows that the higher you need to jump, the harder you could fall. But that's the price you pay to enter the Olympics. You are bound to make mistakes and fail sometimes. But when you do, don’t despair. It's all part of the process. Just try again, and keep moving forward. Don’t spend your valuable time beating yourself up over the past, constantly bemoaning all the mistakes you made. Jewish tradition reminds us that great people make great mistakes. </p>
<p>Of course, you must recognize that you made a mistake, and you should regret it and resolve never to do it again. But don't think that you will never make another mistake. In fact, expect that it’s bound to happen, and no human being is exempt from this.</p>
<p>This is part of our service to God, the aspect of absolute divine perfection that we express. However, we need to remember the profound mystery that God is not only our coach urging us to greater achievements, but is also the source of the runner (the soul) within us. And He has a vested interest in the outcome of the race.</p>
<p>Sometime ago I read a book called I'm O.K., You're O.K. After I read it, I felt O.K. but not great. Maybe I misunderstood the book, but I took it to mean “Nobody's perfect.” Everybody makes mistakes. So just accept that they are O.K., that's O.K,. and you're O.K.</p>
<p>Torah and Kabbalah don't want you to think you are O.K. They want you to know that you are great. Their message is “I’m Great, You’re Great.” We are all manifestations of God’s greatness in this world. We are vehicles for the expression of one type of divine perfection—dynamic perfection. Through you and me God fulfills His desire to participate in the process of teshuvah, making mistakes and growing from them.</p>
<p>We are not just O.K. We are great. And part of our greatness is the possibility to make mistakes, stumble, and fall sometimes. It’s not that we want to fall or try to fall. But sometimes we do make mistakes. No matter how low we fall—even when we intentionally commit horrible crimes—we can always recycle our garbage into the gold of growth and dynamic perfection.
When we realize this, we will be able to forgive ourselves and we will recognize how much God forgives us. God knew when He created this world of chaos that the stakes were very high. He created a world that offers the greatest opportunity for an adventure in becoming perfect. Here is the greatest opportunity for mistakes, yet the greatest opportunity for change and forgiveness. Here is the greatest opportunity for hate, but also the greatest opportunity for love. Here is the greatest opportunity for cruelty, but also the greatest opportunity for kindness.</p>
<p>God knew the stakes were high. Therefore, God forgives us when we make those mistakes, if we are genuine in our recognition of them and work hard to change.</p>
<p>The Talmud, the compilation of Jewish oral tradition, suggests that God also wants our forgiveness. How is this possible?</p>
<p>I have a very loving dentist, and as he drills away at my tooth, he constantly asks me to forgive him for the pain he is causing me. And although everything he is doing is only for my good, it’s possible for me to forget that at times and feel angry. And so, too, in this sometimes painful and challenging life of becoming perfect, it’s important, for our own sakes, to forgive God—even though deep down we intuit that everything that happens is an expression of ultimate goodness. The opportunity to serve God and be a vehicle for His process of becoming perfect is the very gift of life. </p>


<p><b>Is God Absolutely Good?</b></p>

<p>Is God good? Can God choose goodness?</p>
Goodness that isn't chosen is not complete goodness. If we didn’t choose goodness—if we were just naturally good, or if goodness was the only option available—how could that be the highest expression of goodness?
I know a fellow that has dozens of guests over at his home every weekend. When I complimented him on his hospitality, he said, “What are you talking about? It comes naturally to me. It's not a struggle for me. I love to do this!”</p>
<p>Is he really choosing goodness? If it comes naturally, is it complete goodness? Goodness that wasn’t chosen is not the greatest good. Only after you struggle with evil and chose goodness will you accomplish true and complete goodness.</p>
<p>Does God struggle with evil? Can God experience complete goodness through overcoming evil and choosing the good?</p>
	<p>Yes, through you and me. God participates in complete goodness through our choices.</p>
<p>Our service to God is to choose goodness. That's why we're in a world so full of allurements to do evil—so that we can rise to the challenge and choose good. That's our service to God. God needs us to choose good. For there to be choice, evil has to be pretty attractive. There is no choice if we're not interested in one of the alternatives. In other words, if somebody puts in front of me a gorgeous, delicious meal, and next to it a plate of (forgive me) vomit, would it be a tremendous choice that I opted for the meal and not the vomit? </p>
<p>Therefore, in order for there to be the optimal opportunity to choose goodness, evil has to be extremely attractive. People think the Devil is an independent character who has a red ugly face, horns on his head, and a pitchfork in his hand. Kabbalah teaches that the forces of evil were created by God and the strongest ones are a counterfeit of good. They look just like goodness. That's why they present such a great challenge. Evil and good are not always like black and white. High-grade, superclassy evil looks just like good, but it’s counterfeit nevertheless. Counterfeit means that it looks like the real thing but isn’t.</p>
<p>I walk into a store. I hand the cashier a bill. The cashier says, “Thank you, sir. Oh, wait a second! … Sir, I'm sorry, this hundred-dollar bill is worthless; it’s counterfeit.”</p>
<p>I then begin to argue, “What are you talking about? This is a hundred-dollar bill! Do you see the number 100 in the corner?”
The cashier shrugs. “No, I'm sorry, sir, this bill is a worthless piece of paper. President Washington’s right eyeball is slightly off.”
“No, no, this is one hundred dollars. What’s an eyeball got to do with it?”
“Sir, just because it looks, smells, and feels like a hundred-dollar bill doesn’t make it a hundred-dollar bill. Unless it’s printed at the U.S. Mint, it’s worthless.”</p>
<p>So, too, the choices for goodness in real life are often much more subtle than most people recognize. There is a subtle but real difference between “looking good” and “being good.”</p>
<p>Torah and Kabbalah teach that God created the world in order to facilitate the possibility for ultimate goodness, which means goodness that has been chosen. Our service to God is to choose goodness.</p>
<p>Life is all about choices. There are always choices to be made. Every day we are all handed choices. Every day we all get different challenges. No one can expect life to be a piece of cake in a world of choices.
But don’t worry. Try your best, and if you make a mistake, you can do teshuvah. You can be forgiven. Remember, God knew the stakes were high, and God is with you in your pain and struggle.</p>
<p>In fact, the Talmud tells us that before God created the world, He created the power of teshuvah, because the likelihood of our making mistakes was so great that we couldn’t even last a moment without the possibility of teshuvah already available.</p>
<p>Teshuvah is amazing. The Talmud teaches that if we transgress but later on change because we fear punishment, then our offense is considered null and void. But if we transgress but later on mend our ways because of our love for God, then our offense is counted as a merit in the spiritual realm.
Imagine a person who spent their whole life choosing evil and darkness. But moments before they die, they do teshuvah for the love of God. They are able to take all their offenses and turn them into merits and light. How is this possible?</p>
<p>When we do teshuvah out of fear, it means we’re afraid of the pain that is the likely consequence of our choices. When fear motivates our personal transformation, it is because we want to protect ourselves. And that’s a noble move.</p>
<p>However, when we do teshuvah  out of our love for God, the underlying motivation is that we acknowledge the pain and disappointment we have caused God. We realize that God was counting on us to beat evil and choose good, and we failed Him. And we are so sorry for the missed opportunity to reveal this great goodness born out of choice.</p>
<p>Teshuvah done out of love arises from the realization that we are here on earth to perform a divine service—to choose goodness for God’s sake. God wants to participate in complete goodness through our struggle against evil and our choice to do the good, but we have failed Him. We do teshuvha {teshuvah is spelled wrong}not because we fear punishment but because we love God and know that we have, so to speak, let God down. This realization itself brings us closer to God, even closer than we were before we made the mistakes. Therefore, all our offenses turn into merits. The darkness is converted into light.</p>
<p>If God is absolutely good, why did He create a world that has so much evil?</p>
<p>Ultimate goodness, which is the goodness achieved through choice, requires the possibility for evil. Once you understand this, you will appreciate how central a role evil plays in this world. What’s so good about this world is the evil in it. This world offers the opportunity to beat evil and choose good.</p>
<p>In other words, Kabbalah is teaching that the main feature and advantage of this world is the evil in it. This world was not created for what is already good in it. This world was created to be a forum for a new and higher kind of goodness—the goodness born out of overcoming evil and choosing to do good.</p>
<p>Imagine you walk into a factory and you see them trucking in tons and tons of garbage. You then find out that they actually buy this garbage and that it is their most valued raw material. This all sounds crazy to you until you find out that this factory is actually a recycling plant. They take garbage and turn it into usable products. Welcome to World, Inc.!” </p>
<p>Yes, this world is really a recycling plant. This is why it is filled with so much garbage. All the trash around us and within us is here for us to recycle into usable products—lessons and realizations, growth and accomplishments. Before I learned this lesson from Kabbalah, I always wondered why there was so much evil in the world. However, after this secret was revealed to me, I asked:  Why isn’t there more evil in this world? The answer, of course, is that there is less evil because we are working so hard and succeeding in our mission on earth to choose good.</p>


<p><b>We Are Not Alone</b></p>

<p>No tear ever shed in the history of humanity is without divine participation. We are never alone, although we can choose to forget that truth by kicking God out of our awareness, out of our struggles and challenges.</p>
<p>When we pray to God, we are not simply saying, “God, remove all these problems and make everything easy. Snap Your cosmic fingers and make it all better.” When we pray to God, we're actually consciously inviting God into our struggle. In this way we empower ourselves to fulfill our mission in the world.</p>
<p>I think this is one of the most important ideas of Torah and Kabbalah: we're not alone in our struggle, in our challenges, in our pain. God is always with us. God is rooting for us all the time.</p>
<p>In Kabbalah the forces of evil are called sitra acher, “the other side.” One of the tricks of evil is to try to convince you that God is on the other side. You're on one side and God is on the other side. He's not on your side. He is against you.</p>
<p>This is a lie. God is always on your side. No matter how low you feel you have fallen, God is always on your side. To feel this, all you have to do is invite Him in.</p>
<p>A child once asked his father, where is God? His father responded, “Wherever you let Him in.”</p>
<p>The teachings of the Torah and Kabbalah focus on letting God into your process, inviting God into your challenge, and recognizing how much God wants to be involved and is involved in your life, because your true inner self is the soul, a spark of God.</p>
	<p>Therefore, we are incredibly important to God. And God is always with us. If we don't choose to believe that, then—although we are important to God and He is always with us just the same —we won't experience the joy of that truth. </p>


<p><b>In Summary</b></p>

<p>God is not out to get you. God is not on another side. God is always on your side. God has a vested interest in you—because you are a soul, a spark of Himself. You are not God, but you are a spark of God. Although God is beyond you, an aspect of God is manifest within you. Every situation you're in, God orchestrates to maximize your possibility to choose goodness, growth, and achievement.</p>
<p>God is not some magician who casually snapped his finger and created us with no vested interest in what would happen to us. God is not some force removed from our process, pain and struggle, stoically looking down at us while we grapple with life in this world.</p>
<p>According to Torah and Kabbalah, God, who is loving and caring, created you and me in this world as a vehicle for the expression of the full possibility of Himself— His absolute perfection. </p>
<p>God’s absolute perfection, as described from our limited human perspective, has two facets: static perfection (being perfect) and dynamic perfection (becoming perfect). Through you and me, God fulfills His desire to express and participate in a challenging and adventurous process of becoming perfect.</p>
<p>When you realize that you are part of God’s life and God is part of your life, you will discover your holiness, your ultimate meaning and significance. When you realize that you exist within the Endless Light of God, you will discover that God’s Endless Light is also inside of you. You will understand that an aspect of God’s absolute perfection—the dynamic perfection—is expressed through you. Your divine privilege is to be a human being who serves as a vehicle for God. When you serve the ultimate, then you're part of the ultimate. When you realize that you're part of the ultimate, then you experience the perfection of every moment.</p>
            <p>Here’s the menu put simply: God is living His secret life through you.</p>
            <p>Take a moment to contemplate, feel, and taste this delicious truth. Take a lifetime to live it and celebrate it.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
There is truly nothing besides Him.
An illustration of this is the light of the sun which illumines the earth and its inhabitants. [This illumination] is the radiance and the light which spreads forth from the body of the sun and is visible to all as it gives light to the earth and the expanse of the universe. Now, it is self-evident that this light and radiance is also present in the very body and matter of the sun-globe itself in the sky, for if it can spread forth and shine to such a great distance, then certainly it can shed light in its own place. However, there in its own place, this radiance is considered naught and complete nothingness, for it is absolutely non-existent in relation to the body of the sun-globe which is the source of this light and radiance, inasmuch as this radiance and light is merely the illumination which shines from the body of the sun-globe itself. It is only in the space of the universe, under the heavens and on the earth, where the body of the sun-globe is not present, that this light and radiance appears to the eye to have actual existence. And here, the term YESH ("existence") can truly be applied to it, whereas, when it is in its source, in the body of the sun, the term YESH ("existence") cannot be applied to it at all, and it can only be called naught and nonexistent. There it is indeed naught and absolutely non-existent, for there, only its source, the body of the sun, gives light, and there is nothing besides it.
The exact parallel to this illustration is the relationship between all created things and the Divine flow [of the life-force] from the "Breath of His mouth," which flows upon them and brings them into existence. G-d is their source, and they themselves are merely like a diffusing light and effulgence from the flow and spirit of G-d, which issues forth and becomes clothed in them and brings them from naught into being. Hence, their existence is nullified in relation to their source, just as the light of the sun is nullified and is considered naught and complete nothingness and is not [even] referred to as "existing" at all when it is in its source; only beneath the heavens, where its source is not present [can it be called "existing"]. In the same manner, the term YESH ("existence") can be applied to all created things only [as they appear] to our corporeal eyes, for we do not see nor comprehend at all the source, which is the spirit of G-d, that brings them into existence. Therefore, it appears to our eyes that the materiality, grossness and tangibility of the created things actually exist, just as the light of the sun appears to have actual existence when it is not within its source.
But in the following, the illustration is apparently not completely identical with the object of comparison. For in the illustration, the source [the sun] is not present at all in the space of the universe and upon the earth where its light is seen as actually existing. Whereas, all created things are always within their source, and it is only that the source is not visible to our physical eyes. [If so], why are they not nullified in their source? To understand this, some prefatory remarks are necessary.</p>
<p>
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
It is written: “For a sun and a shield is Hava'ye Elokim.” The explanation of this verse (is as follows]: “Shield” is a covering for the sun, to protect the creatures so that they should be able to bear [its heat]. As our Sages, of blessed memory, have said, “In Time to Come, the Holy One, blessed be He, will take out the sun from its sheath, the wicked will be punished by it . ...” Now, just as the covering shields (i.e., conceals] the sun, so does the name Elokim shield (i.e., conceal] the name Hava'ye, blessed be He.
The meaning of the name Hava'ye is “That which brings everything into existence ex nihilo.” The prefix י [added to the stem הוה], modifies the verb, indicating that the action is present and continuous - as Rashi comments on the verse, “In this manner does Job do יעשה all the days” - i.e., the life-force which flows at every instant into all things created, from “that which proceeds out of the mouth of “G d” and “His breath,” and brings them into existence ex nihilo at every moment. For the fact that they were created during the Six Days of Creation is not sufficient for their continued existence, as explained above.
 … life-force conceals itself in the body of the created being and [it appears] as though the body of the created being has independent existence and is not [merely] a spreading forth of the life-force and spirituality— as the diffusion of the radiation and light from the sun— but an independently existing entity. Although, in reality, it has no independent existence, and is only like the diffusion of the light from the sun…
