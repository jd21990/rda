**Ray**: Doc I don’t know. I used to be a really radiant energetic guy. People were in awe of my brilliance; drawn to my warmth. I had a shining personality.  I’d just walk into a room and it would light up. I was cheerful, lighthearted and always saw the bright side of things. I never had a shadow in my life.

**Doc**: So what changed?

**Ray**: I don’t know... my life’s just gone dark. I’m just so heavy now. My friends tell me, Ray lighten up. But I can’t. I just want to burst out and shine but feel so disconnected. Is there any hope for a new dawn in my life?

**Doc**: Ray, do you believe in the sun?

**Ray**: Oh no, Please, Doc, don't start up with ray-ligion. I gave up believing in the sun long time ago. For years, as a kid, I went to Sunday school and hated it. My parents forced me to go to sunagogue. And not a few times, Doc, I was beat up by Anti-Sunites.

**Doc**: I understand

**Ray**: My parents told me that we’re all children of the sun- that we’re the light of His life. And that the secret to happiness was to serve Him. Well no thank you. I’m no slave.

**Doc**: Ray, the Sun is not a tyrant imposing his will on us. He’s the Source of our lives, the Soul of our souls; He’s our shared Greater Self. We cannot but want to serve the Sun because we are rays of His light; through us He becomes present on earth. 

**Ray**: Doc, You're freaking me out. 

**Doc**: Ray, the Sun loves us with the very love he loves himself because we are a part of Him.

**Ray**: Doc, I'm not the ray-ligious kind of guy. Not the holy type.

**Doc**: I'm talking about you, Ray, not religion. To be holy means to be completely and Wholly     w- h-o-l--l-y you.

**Ray**: Doc, I don't feel it. Maybe I'm just not connected to the sun. Maybe I'm a sinner. 

**Doc**: Ray you’re always connected. No act can change that fact. You're forever a part of the Sun. It’s only your beliefs and lifestyle that set you a part from Him in your mind.

**Ray**: So what do I have to do?

**Doc**: Ray act in ways that portray and not betray you.

**Ray**: So it’s fake it till you make it. Doc, I can't pretend to be someone I'm not.

**Doc**: No, Ray. It’s fake it till you awake it. Deep within we know the truth. The path to wellness is to make the unconscious conscious. 

**Ray**: Huh? You lost me Doc.

**Doc**: Ray the feeling of disconnect depresses you because deep inside, you know it’s not true. Ray we’re rays of the sun. We’re connected this very moment.

**Ray**: So then why do I feel so bad if the connection can never be broken?

**Doc**: Your connection can never be broken but it can be denied. The conflict between who you are and what you believe about yourself is causing you all this stress and sadness.

**Ray**: So what do I have to do to my let light shine again?

**Doc**: Ray, That's precisely your problem. Listen to what you’re saying. You think it's your light. It's not your light it’s His. All the powers within us are not from us. And they're not just His gifts to us they're His presence within us. 

**Ray**: You mean, feeling great starts with feeling grateful. 

**Doc**: Right on.

**Ray**: Doc, you're brilliant.  

**Doc**: No Ray, He's brilliant. [Doc points to the sun]

**Ray**: Oh ya. Well thanks for being wholly you. I’m already starting to feel sun-sational.

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
There is truly nothing besides Him.
An illustration of this is the light of the sun which illumines the earth and its inhabitants. [This illumination] is the radiance and the light which spreads forth from the body of the sun and is visible to all as it gives light to the earth and the expanse of the universe. Now, it is self-evident that this light and radiance is also present in the very body and matter of the sun-globe itself in the sky, for if it can spread forth and shine to such a great distance, then certainly it can shed light in its own place. However, there in its own place, this radiance is considered naught and complete nothingness, for it is absolutely non-existent in relation to the body of the sun-globe which is the source of this light and radiance, inasmuch as this radiance and light is merely the illumination which shines from the body of the sun-globe itself. It is only in the space of the universe, under the heavens and on the earth, where the body of the sun-globe is not present, that this light and radiance appears to the eye to have actual existence. And here, the term YESH ("existence") can truly be applied to it, whereas, when it is in its source, in the body of the sun, the term YESH ("existence") cannot be applied to it at all, and it can only be called naught and nonexistent. There it is indeed naught and absolutely non-existent, for there, only its source, the body of the sun, gives light, and there is nothing besides it.
The exact parallel to this illustration is the relationship between all created things and the Divine flow [of the life-force] from the "Breath of His mouth," which flows upon them and brings them into existence. G-d is their source, and they themselves are merely like a diffusing light and effulgence from the flow and spirit of G-d, which issues forth and becomes clothed in them and brings them from naught into being. Hence, their existence is nullified in relation to their source, just as the light of the sun is nullified and is considered naught and complete nothingness and is not [even] referred to as "existing" at all when it is in its source; only beneath the heavens, where its source is not present [can it be called "existing"]. In the same manner, the term YESH ("existence") can be applied to all created things only [as they appear] to our corporeal eyes, for we do not see nor comprehend at all the source, which is the spirit of G-d, that brings them into existence. Therefore, it appears to our eyes that the materiality, grossness and tangibility of the created things actually exist, just as the light of the sun appears to have actual existence when it is not within its source.
But in the following, the illustration is apparently not completely identical with the object of comparison. For in the illustration, the source [the sun] is not present at all in the space of the universe and upon the earth where its light is seen as actually existing. Whereas, all created things are always within their source, and it is only that the source is not visible to our physical eyes. [If so], why are they not nullified in their source? To understand this, some prefatory remarks are necessary.</p>

<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
It is written: “For a sun and a shield is Hava'ye Elokim.” The explanation of this verse (is as follows]: “Shield” is a covering for the sun, to protect the creatures so that they should be able to bear [its heat]. As our Sages, of blessed memory, have said, “In Time to Come, the Holy One, blessed be He, will take out the sun from its sheath, the wicked will be punished by it . ...” Now, just as the covering shields (i.e., conceals] the sun, so does the name Elokim shield (i.e., conceal] the name Hava'ye, blessed be He.
The meaning of the name Hava'ye is “That which brings everything into existence ex nihilo.” The prefix י [added to the stem הוה], modifies the verb, indicating that the action is present and continuous - as Rashi comments on the verse, “In this manner does Job do יעשה all the days” - i.e., the life-force which flows at every instant into all things created, from “that which proceeds out of the mouth of “G d” and “His breath,” and brings them into existence ex nihilo at every moment. For the fact that they were created during the Six Days of Creation is not sufficient for their continued existence, as explained above.
 … life-force conceals itself in the body of the created being and [it appears] as though the body of the created being has independent existence and is not [merely] a spreading forth of the life-force and spirituality— as the diffusion of the radiation and light from the sun— but an independently existing entity. Although, in reality, it has no independent existence, and is only like the diffusion of the light from the sun…
